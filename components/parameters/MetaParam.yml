  A comma separated list of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's
  `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each
  resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not
  apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be
  clearly labeled.
