title: Container
type: object
description: Containers are a way to package together your application along with it's dependencies, and run in a resource isolated process. They provide consistency across different hosts, efficiency over traditional hosting methods, and facilitate a micro-service based approach, where each logical piece of your application is split into multiple, easily testable parts (such as API, Backend, Frontend, etc).
