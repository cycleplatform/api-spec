title: Identifier
type: string
description: |
  A human-readable identifier used to refer to a resource, where using the official ID may be inconvenient.
  The identifier is tokenized from the name/relevant field of the resource. For example, a container named "My Container" will
  have the identifier of `my-container` and is automatically created by the platform.

  Though an identifier generally refers to one specific resource, there may be cases where multiple resources have the same identifier.
