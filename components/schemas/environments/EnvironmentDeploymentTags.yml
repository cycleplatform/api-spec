title: EnvironmentDeploymentTags
type: object
description: |
  A map of custom tags to deployment versions. Allows for defining a custom, persistent tag with a changing version number. 
  For example, `dev -> v1.2.3-dev`. This is useful when dealing with DNS LINKED records, where you always want dev.example.com to point to the 
  `dev` version of your app within an environment, where you can continuously deploy and update it without needing to change the record. It is 
  even more useful when you have multiple LINKED records, and you update i.e. `prod`` tag to point to a new version, all records using the `prod` tag
  are switched at once.
