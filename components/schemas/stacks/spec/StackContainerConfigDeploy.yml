      - ** resource-density **: Cycle will distribute instances across servers to maintain balanced resource usage.
      - ** high-availability **: Cycle will deploy instances over servers with an emphasis on geographic and physical separation
      - ** first-available **: Cycle will deploy one instance to every node that matches the specified criteria. (default)
      - ** node **: Cycle will deploy one instance to every node that matches the specified criteria.
      - ** edge **: Cycle will prioritize geographic distribution of instances.
      - ** function **: Every ingress request/connection receives its own instance. 
      - ** manual **: Cycle will not make any decisions on where instances are deployed. Instead, instances must be deployed manually using the portal or API.

          This command accepts two types of entries:

          - The first is a reference to a script that already lives in the container filesystem. This can be defined by giving the full path to the script as the value.  
          - The second format is an inline script.  If you need the code to execute within a shell, wrap the commands in escaped quotes like this `"\"curl -s -o /dev/console -w \"%{http_code}\" http://localhost:3000/_health | grep '200'  && exit 0 || exit 1\""`.
