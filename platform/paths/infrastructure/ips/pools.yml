        A comma separated list of include values. Included resources will show
        up under the root document's `include` field, with the key being the id of the included
        resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two
        resources share the same include, it will only appear once in the return.

        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          available:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[available]=true` filter for IPs that are available for use.
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the IP's current state.
          server:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[server]=ID` server filtering by ID. Submit the ID of the server you wish to filter for and the return will be any IP pool associated with that server.
          location:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[location]=ID` location filtering by ID. Submit the ID of the location you wish to filter by.
