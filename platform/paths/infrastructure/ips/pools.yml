        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        type: object
        properties:
          available:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[available]=true` filter for IPs that are available for use.
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the IP's current state.
