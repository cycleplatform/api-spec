                Defines which deployment containers to include in the stack export. By default, no containers tagged in a deployment are exported.
                This option includes all containers with the specific, comma separated deployment tags in the final output in addition to the
                containers that are not part of any deployment.

                When set to true, Cycle will resolve image origins and inline them into the stack, essentially making this stack portable outside the hub it's currently used in.
                By default, this is set to false, and the export will just reference existing image sources used by this stack in your hub by ID.
