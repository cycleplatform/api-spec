  summary: Get Search Index
  description: |
    Gets a pre-built search index, containing IDs and basic information for many commonly used resources on the Hub.
    Can be used to build a 'quick search' functionality for referencing the most frequently used resources.

    Requires the `view` capability for each returned segment, i.e. to retrieve Containers, you must have `containers-view`.
