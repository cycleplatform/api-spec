  summary: Get Stack Build Log
  description: |
    Requests the log generated during a stack build. 
    The response log includes  log entries for the stack build process, 
    but individual image build logs must be fetched from the 
    generated image. When a stack build fails due to an invalid spec, 
    the incorrect spec, with populated variables, 
    will be included in the log.

    Requires the `stacks-view` capability.
