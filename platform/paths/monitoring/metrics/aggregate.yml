  summary: Generate Aggregated Metrics
  description: |
    Generate a metric report using an aggregated pipeline query with Mongo. This endpoint provides ultimate
    flexibility in generating data for dashboards, charts, graphs, etc. 

    You should always provide a time range filter to this call, either through the filter parameter or in the critera body. The aggregate is limited to 25,000 input documents, so a time frame will give the best results. 

    Requires the `monitor-view` capability.

        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          range-start:
            description: The start date from when to pull metrics. Providing 'time' in the post-body criteria field will override this filter.
            $ref: ../../../../components/schemas/DateTime.yml
          range-end:
            description: The end date from when to pull metrics. Providing 'time' in the post-body criteria field will override this filter.
