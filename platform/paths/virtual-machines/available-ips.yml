    For an IP address to be assignable to a virtual machine, it must follow these rules:

    1. The IP address must be assigned to the same location as the virtual machine.
    2. The IP address must be from a server that supports the `gateway` service.
    3. The IP address must be in the `available` state.

    Requires the `virtual-machines-view` capability.
