        A comma-separated list of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's `meta` field.
        In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each resource will have its own relevant meta data.
        In some rare cases, meta may not apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be clearly labeled.
