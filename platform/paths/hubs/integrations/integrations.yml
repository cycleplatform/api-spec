        `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each
        resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not
        apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be
        clearly labeled.

        ## Filter Field
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for. Supports filtering by state and a text search.
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value` Filters integrations by their current state. For example, `filter[state]=active` would return only integrations in an active state.
          search:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[search]=value` Performs a text search across relevant fields of the integrations. For example, `filter[search]=example` would return integrations that have "example" in any of the searchable fields
          category:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[category]=value` Filters integrations by their category. For example, `filter[category]=infrastructure-provider` would return only integrations that are capable of provisioning infrastructure.
