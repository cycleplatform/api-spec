        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        type: object
        properties:
          identifier:
            type: string

              `filter[identifier]=value` only return global load balancers that match the identifier
          search:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given global load balancer(s).
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the global load balancer's current state.
