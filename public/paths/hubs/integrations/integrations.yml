        ## Filter Field
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for. Supports filtering by state and a text search.
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value` Filters integrations by their current state. For example, `filter[state]=active` would return only integrations in an active state.
          search:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[search]=value` Performs a text search across relevant fields of the integrations. For example, `filter[search]=example` would return integrations that have "example" in any of the searchable fields
          identifier:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[identifier]=value` Filters integrations by their identifier. For example, `filter[identifier]=abstraction` would return only integrations with the abstraction identifier.
