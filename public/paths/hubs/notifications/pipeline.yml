  summary: Hub Notification Pipeline Auth
  description: |
    Initializes authorization for the Hub notification pipeline. The Hub notification pipeline is a one-way streaming websocket that
    sends real-time 'notifications' as things are happening on the Hub. These notifications tell some basic information about an event,
    and it is up to the user to fetch additional details, if deemed necessary.

    Requesting this endpoint without a `?token=<token>` URL parameter will result in receiving a short lived token in the response body. That 
    token can then be applied to the URL parameter to the same endpoint to upgrade the connection to a websocket.

    Requires the `apionly-notifications-listen` capability.
