        ## Filter Field
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Search
        `filter[search]=value` search activities for a value associated with a field on the given activity(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the activity's current state.

        ### User 
        `filter[user]=ID` user filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the user you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that user.

        ### Environment
        `filter[environment]=ID` environment filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the environment you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that environment.

        ### container
        `filter[container]=ID` container filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the container you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that container.

        ### Instance
        `filter[instance]=ID` instance filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the instance you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that instance.

        ### Server
        `filter[server]=ID` server filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the server you wish to filter for and the return will be any activity from that server.

        ### Event
        `filter[event]=value` filter by event occurrence. Example: `filter[event]=environment.services.vpn.login`

        ### Verbosity
        `filter[verbosity]=integer` filter the activity return by verbosity. The verbosity can be:

          `0` - Activity that users would find useful.
          `1` - Activity that can be useful when tracking down how something happened. 
          `2` - Full activity, can be useful in debugging problems.
