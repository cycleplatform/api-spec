        A comma separated list of include values. Included resources will show

        resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two
        resources share the same include, it will only appear once in the return.

        ## Filter Field
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Identifier
        `filter[identifier]=value` List only those pipelines matching this identifier. May return multiple results.
        
        ### Search
        `filter[search]=value` search pipelines for a value associated with a field on the given pipeline(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the pipeline's current state.
