        A comma separated list of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's
        `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each
        resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not
        apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be
        clearly labeled.

        up under the root document's `include` field, with the key being the id of the included
        resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two
        resources share the same include, it will only appear once in the return.

        ## Filter Field
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Search
        `filter[search]=value` search containers for a value associated with a field on the given container(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the container's current state.

        ### Service
        `filter[service]=value` service filtering will allow you to filter by service type: `loadbalancer`, `discovery`, `vpn`.

        ### Public Network
        `filter[public_network]=value` public network filtering will allow you to filter by the containers network settings: `enabled`, `disabled`, `egress-only`.

        ### Image 
        `filter[image]=ID` image filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the image you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers currently using the image.

        ### Environment
        `filter[environment]=ID` environment filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the environment you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers in that environment.

        ### Tags
        `filter[tags]=tagone,tagtwo,tagthree` container filtering using server tags. If the container has the tags you submit it will be part of the return. 

        ### Stacks
        `filter[stack]=ID` stack filtering by ID.  Submit the ID of the stack you wish to filter for and the return will be any containers deployed associated with 'containers' from the stack.
