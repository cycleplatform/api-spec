      description:
        A comma separated list of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's
        `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each
        resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not
        apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be
        clearly labeled.

        A comma separated list of include values. Included resources will show
        up under the root document's `include` field, with the key being the id of the included
        resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two
        resources share the same include, it will only appear once in the return.

        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Search 
        `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given image(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the image's current state.

        ### Source Type
        `filter[source_type]=value` filter images by the image source's type.  Can be: `direct` or `stack_build`

        ### Source
        `filter[source_id]=ID` image filtering by source ID.  Submit the ID of the image source you wish to filter for and the return will be any images created from that source.
