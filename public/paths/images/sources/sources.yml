      description:
        A comma separated list of meta values. Meta values will show up under a resource's
        `meta` field. In the case of applying a meta to a collection of resources, each
        resource will have it's own relevant meta data. In some rare cases, meta may not
        apply to individual resources, and may appear in the root document. These will be
        clearly labeled.

      description:
        A comma separated list of include values. Included resources will show
        up under the root document's `include` field, with the key being the id of the included
        resource. In the case of applying an include to a collection of resources, if two
        resources share the same include, it will only appear once in the return.

        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.
      schema:
        type: object
        properties:
          identifier:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[identifier]=value` List only those image sources matching this identifier. May return multiple results.
          search:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given Image Source(s).
          state:
            type: string
            description: |
              `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the Image Source's current state.
