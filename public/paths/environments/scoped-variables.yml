        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Search 
        `filter[search]=value` search for a value associated with a field on the given scoped variable(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the scoped variable's current state.
