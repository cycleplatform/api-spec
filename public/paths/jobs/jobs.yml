        ## Filter Field 
        The filter field is a key-value object, where the key is what you would like to filter, and the value is the value you're filtering for.

        ## Possible Values
        ### Range 
        `filter[range-start]=timestamp&filter[range-end]=timestamp` filter by range giving two times a `start` time and an `end` time. Date format `2023-03-07T14:55:17-08:00`.

        ### Search
        `filter[search]=value` search jobs for a value associated with a field on the given job(s).

        ### State
        `filter[state]=value1,value2` state filtering will allow you to filter by the job's current state.
