  bind_host:
    description: |
      Binds the load balancer to the host server IP address. 

      **Pros**: This allows for significantly lower cost (utilizing fewer IPv4 addresses), and enables building out a true edge network with lower latency.
      **Cons**: Only 1 environment is allowed on the host. This is because the load balancer is the only ingress point for an environment, and if it is sharing
      the same IP as the host, that host can only operate under that environment.
